[INFO] WELCOME! This challenge makes the following asks of you:
[INFO] - the challenge checks for a specific parent process : python
[INFO] - the challenge will require the parent to send number of signals : 50
[INFO] - the challenge will output a reward file if all the tests pass : /flag

[HYPE] ONWARDS TO GREATNESS!

[INFO] This challenge will perform a bunch of checks.
[INFO] If you pass these checks, you will receive the /flag file.

[TEST] Performing checks on the parent process of this process.
[TEST] We will now check that that the process is a non-interactive python instance (i.e., an executing python script).

[INFO] The process' executable is /nix/store/pa7plncc30fhm909bis9haakh7gi0qbl-bash-interactive-5.2p37/bin/bash.
[INFO] This might be different than expected because of symbolic links (for example, from /usr/bin/python to /usr/bin/python3 to /usr/bin/python3.8).
[INFO] To pass the checks, the executable must be python3.8.

[FAIL] You did not satisfy all the execution requirements.
[FAIL] Specifically, you must fix the following issue:
[FAIL]   Executable must be 'python3.8'. Yours is: bash
